# The Portfolio Project

Welcome to the newly-designed Portfolio Project from the American Statistical Association's Committee on Career Development. We are excited to share this with our community, broadly defined. 

In brief, the Portfolio Project is interested in sharing resources for developing and maintaining a strong online presence in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. We hope that the content shared through the Project is useful to scholars, practitioners, and researchers at all skill and career levels in statistics, data science, and beyond. 

Keep an eye on the Project (or better yet, bookmark the page) so you can stay up to date with us and the new content. We plan to post semi-regularly, around 1-2 times a month more or less.

And of course, do [reach out](mailto:philip.waggoner@yougov.com) to let us know if you find errors, bugs, or have suggestions for topics to cover or people to interview. We welcome wide engagement at any level.
