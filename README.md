# The Portfolio Project

Welcome to the newly-designed Portfolio Project from the American Statistical Association's [Committee on Career Development](https://community.amstat.org/ccd/home). We are excited to share this with our community, broadly defined. 

In brief, the Portfolio Project is interested in sharing resources for developing and maintaining a strong online presence in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. We hope that the content shared through the Project is useful to scholars, practitioners, and researchers at all skill and career levels in statistics, data science, and beyond. 

Keep an eye on the Project (or better yet, bookmark the page) so you can stay up to date with us and the new content. We plan to post semi-regularly, around 1-2 times a month more or less. 

Take a look at the Project here:

And of course, do [reach out](mailto:philip.waggoner@yougov.com) to let us know if you find errors, bugs, or have suggestions for topics to cover or people to interview. We welcome wide engagement at any level. 

## Interested in Contributing to the Blog?

We are excited to pool collective knowledge about careers in data science and statistics. To this end, we welcome contributions to the blog re: data science, statistics, technology, professional development, real world data experience and anecdotes, and so on. 

To contribute, you can either [reach out directly](mailto:philip.waggoner@yougov.com) with a request or post, and we will post it for you. Or, you can directly contribute by suggesting a change via pull request. To do so: 

  1. Fork the repo
  2. Add your post in the `post` folder as a new `.md` file
  3. Request a merge of your branch. 
 
We will quickly review, and merge the branch to publish your post if it is aligned with the CCD's interests. If it is not immediately obvious how your post fits in, we will comment on the pull request with questions, comments, and a general review to ensure we are on the same page before posting. 

Thanks for contributing!
