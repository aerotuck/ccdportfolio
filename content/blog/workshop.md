# Overview

On May 13, 2022, the CCD committee hosted an online workshop addressing the role and value of developing maintaining a technology portfolio. 

During the workshop, we also demonstrated how to get started by walking participants through how we think about and actively develop our (CCD) portfolio. [Take a look at the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5vUgoz2APM) if you missed it.

And don't forget to contribute directly to the blog if you've got something to share re: data science, technology, professional tips and tricks, the practice of statistics, etc. 

Take a look at the guide [here](https://ccdportfolio.netlify.app/contribute/), or of course feel free to [reach out directly](mailto:philip.waggoner@gmail.com) to workshop an idea you're unsure about.
