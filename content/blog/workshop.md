## Workshop

On May 13, 2022, the CCD committee hosted an online workshop addressing the role and value of developing and maintaining a technology portfolio. 

During the workshop, we also demonstrated how to get started by walking participants through how we think about and actively develop our (CCD) portfolio. [Take a look at the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5vUgoz2APM) if you missed it.
